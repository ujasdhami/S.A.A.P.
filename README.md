# Synchronous Automobile Alarming Protocol (S.A.A.P)

Source codes for the operations of Arduino A & Arduino B of the S.A.A.P project. 
Sensors used/mounted, respectively, are:

* Temperature Sensor
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Shock Sensor
* Sound Sensor
* Voltage Sensor
* GPS Module
* SMS Module
* Digital Screen
* Four LEDs
* Buzzer

## Connections in Aa and Ab

Arduino A has the integrations of: 

* Temperature Sensor
* Sound Sensor
* Voltage Sensor
* LCD Display 

Arduino B has the integrations of: 

* GPS Module
* SMS Module
* Shock Sensor
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* LEDs
* Buzzer

Both, Arduino A and B, are inter-connected with jump-wires through the BreadBoard. Ports are listed in the Source Code respectively.
